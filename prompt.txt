3. Identify which activities correlate with higher data usage.
4. Highlight any anomalies (e.g. sudden spikes, freezes, battery drops).
5. Suggest bundle sizes that match the player’s average usage.
6. Offer tips to reduce data usage based on their setup and habits.
7. Optionally, tag each session with 3–5 keywords summarizing its theme.

The CSV will be pasted below. Begin your analysis once the data is provided.
